# Chess Analysis Platform - replit.md

## Overview

EduChessClub is a comprehensive chess analysis platform designed for tournament players. It provides opponent scouting, game database management, position analysis, and learning tools. The application integrates with external chess services like Lichess and includes a real-time Stockfish chess engine for deep position analysis.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom chess-themed color scheme
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with structured responses

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Management**: Type-safe schema definitions in shared module
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL adapter
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit for schema migrations

## Key Components

### Chess Engine Integration
- **Primary Engine**: Stockfish integration for position analysis
- **Fallback Analysis**: Custom evaluation algorithms when Stockfish unavailable
- **Analysis Features**: Position evaluation, best move suggestions, tactical pattern recognition
- **Performance**: Configurable depth analysis (default 15 ply)

### External API Integrations
- **Lichess API**: Game import, player statistics, tournament data retrieval
- **API Management**: Token-based authentication with rate limiting consideration
- **Data Processing**: PGN parsing and chess.js integration for move validation

### User Management System
- **Player Profiles**: FIDE ID, AICF ID, Lichess ID linking
- **Rating Tracking**: Current rating, puzzle rating, performance statistics
- **Game History**: Personal game database with analysis metadata

### Game Analysis System
- **PGN Processing**: Full game parsing with move-by-move analysis
- **Opening Classification**: Automatic opening detection and repertoire analysis
- **Tactical Analysis**: Blunder detection, missed tactics identification
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy calculation, move quality assessment

## Data Flow

### Game Import Flow
1. User inputs opponent username or game PGN
2. System queries Lichess API for game data
3. Games are processed through chess.js for validation
4. Stockfish analysis is applied to each position
5. Results stored in PostgreSQL with analysis metadata
6. Frontend displays analyzed games with insights

### Opponent Scouting Flow
1. User searches for opponent by username/ID
2. System retrieves historical games from database and Lichess
3. Opening repertoire analysis is performed
4. Tactical weaknesses are identified through pattern recognition
5. Statistical summaries are generated and cached
6. Results presented in interactive dashboard format

### Position Analysis Flow
1. User inputs FEN position or selects from game
2. Position is validated through chess.js
3. Stockfish engine analyzes position at configured depth
4. Alternative moves are evaluated and ranked
5. Tactical themes are identified (pins, forks, skewers, etc.)
6. Analysis results displayed with visual board representation
